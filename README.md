# Deep Learning in Java - Iris Classifier 
This is a maven project where we implement Deep learning.
We use deeplearnign4j library to create Neural network models in Java to create a classifier ower the Iris Dataset.

## Prerequisites
- JDK 1.8 or later (1.8 used in this project)
- Apache Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA/ Eclipse (IntelliJ used in this project)
- Git

## Maven Libraries
- apache.cassandra.all (4.0.5 used)
- deeplearning4j.core (0.9.1 used)
- nd4j.native.platform (0.9.1 used)

## About Deeplearning4j
As the name suggests us, the library is written in Java and is compatible with Java Virtual Machine language, such as Kotlin, Scala etc. It is an open-source distributed deep learning library which has an advantage of the latest distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark and Hadoop. Some of its features are:

- Commercial-grade and open-source
- Brings AI to business environments
- Detailed API doc
- Sample projects in multiple languages
- Integrated with Hadoop and Apache Spark
